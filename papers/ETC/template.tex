\begin{abstract}
  Consistency is a key property of any logical system. However, proofs of
  consistency usually rely on heavy proof theory notions like admissibility
  of cut. A more semantics based approach to consistency proofs is to explore the
  correspondence between a logics and its relation with the
  evaluation in a $\lambda$-calculus, known as Curry-Howard isomorphism.
  In this work, we describe a Coq formalization of consistency of minimal
  propositional logics using this semantics approach and compare it with 
  the traditional approaches used in proof theory.
