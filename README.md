Formalizing consistency of minimal propositional logics in Coq
=========================

This repository contains proofs of consistency for minimal propositional 
logics in Coq. One proof is based on the admissibility of cut property and 
another one by using a normalization argument.

All results are completely verified using Coq version 8.10.2.
